     *
     * Development and CI run `database` so a developer needs no Redis; production
     * runs `redis` (PD-07, architecture.md §22). Both are configured below with
     * IDENTICAL semantics, so switching is an environment change and nothing else.
     *
     * NEVER set this to `sync` outside the test suite. Under `sync` a mailable
     * runs inside the originating request, which breaks AC-33: a mail failure
     * would surface as a request failure and roll back the enrollment
     * transaction that triggered it.
